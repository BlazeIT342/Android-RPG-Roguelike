# Android-RPG-Roguelike

## Idea
The aim was to create an **androind roguelike game** about the demon, that will be slaying angels. 

The game is limited in time. Player's aim is to **survive 10 minutes** and **kill all bosses**. To do that, player has **2 speells** and **perks**, the choose of which will appear after every levelup.

## About
Now the game is in process, but I have already did the most part of it.

## In process
* Boss's mechanic 
* Variants of characters
* Variants of spells for each character
* In-game currency system
